"Metroid Dread," which I purchased some time ago, finally arrived today :tada:! This was the Nintendo game I was most interested in among those released last year (2021).

As soon as the delivery arrived, I eagerly went to pick it up. The moment I got home, I popped it into my Switch Lite :video_game: and gave it a try.
My first impression was how incredibly smooth and fluid the movements were. The thrill brought by this seamless action experience is simply addictive :heart_eyes:!

More experiences will only be discovered as I slowly play through the game later on!!!
Looking forward to the upcoming game content.
