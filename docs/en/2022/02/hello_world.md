Hello, World!

This is my first official blog launch. I previously tried to implement a blog using `Python` and `Flask`, but I eventually gave up because the content was too cumbersome.

<!-- more -->

Later, I discovered `VuePress`, which allows writing locally, pushing to `GitHub`, and then using `actions` for automated deployment to `GitHub Pages`. This smooth writing experience deeply attracted me and reignited my desire to try blogging. Finally, after a day of tinkering, I managed to get this Blog configured quite decently.

I hope I can keep writing for a long, long time!
