It's hard to imagine what our world would be like today without open-source software!

Without open source, if we needed to develop a program now, we would have to start from scratch, building all sorts of wheels ourselves. This would be like completing programming practice in our freshman year, entirely implementing every function's code by hand—truly an agonizing memory 😞.

But with open source, it's completely different. Because of open source, we can freely use code that others have already written under specified open-source licenses. This means we no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, when writing a Python web crawler, we only need to install the `requests` package to make HTTP requests. With open source, we can implement desired functionalities more efficiently and quickly, making coding a much more comfortable experience ☺️.

I officially got involved with open source in 2020. In the initial stage, I mainly open-sourced code I wrote myself, perhaps for homework or some simple mini-programs and games. Of course, any open-source content is welcome in the open-source world; no one will criticize you for your open-source code or content being "too basic." By the end of 2021, I truly began participating in other people's open-source projects. This was my open-source元年 (first year of open source), and since then, I've continuously submitted a lot of code to open-source repositories.

Currently, I've only submitted code to two repositories: [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub), which focuses on generating RSS feeds for various websites, and [script-commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) for the macOS quick launch software Raycast. Among these, RSSHub has received the most contributions.

As of writing, I have submitted 101 [PRs](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commits?author=Fatpandac) to RSSHub, while Raycast's script-commands only has two.

In the process of submitting PRs, I witnessed the warmth and mutual help within the open-source community.

When submitting PRs to the RSSHub and script-commands repositories, the repository administrators ([TonyRL](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commits?author=TonyRL), [DIYgod](https://github.com/DIYgod), [unnamedd](https://github.com/unnamedd), [dehesa](https://github.com/dehesa), etc.) provided many useful suggestions for my code. This made me feel the spirit of the open-source community ❤️️, where everyone is equal and no one looks down on you because of your labels or coding proficiency.

Isn't it cool that participating in open source allows more people to use the code I've written?

Maybe one day you'll encounter a user who's using your open-source code, and you can proudly say to the person next to you:

> Hey, that guy is using the code I wrote!

How cool is that!

In fact, there's no difficulty in participating in open-source projects. As long as you have the idea of contributing to open source, you should act immediately. Submit PRs, issues to other people's projects, or open-source your own projects. Every PR you submit, every issue you raise, and every project you open-source is an invaluable contribution to the open-source world.

Open source with love, and make the world a better place! ❤️️
