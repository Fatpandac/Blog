    Hi there! I’m Fatpandac. Here, I share things I find interesting or useful. It might be a random idea, a small need, or just something from my everyday life.
    Sometimes I also write about the tools I’m building, such as DocSearch, hn-rs, fuckcqooc, and more.
    If you’re into this kind of stuff, feel free to join in, exchange ideas, or even roast a little.
